In this folder I will mostly cover AI topics, not so related on how to code AI's but in how to use
the most recent and relevant features and tools that are raising within AI community.
(This doesnt mean that there is not going to be code involved, just not to code AI)

Although the previous lines spececify the main purpose of this folder I could potentially include a wide variety of other topics hera that could be not so relevant for the serverless research.
