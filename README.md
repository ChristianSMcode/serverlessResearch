Objective and overall explanation
=================================
The purpose of this repo is just to document some of the features of different AWS services related to
serverless infrastructure.Also this will include some demos to illustrate real scenarios applying some of 
the features.

Where to start

You should start with the guide folder and follow the order of the files which will the lead you to the demos
folder, in the postmanCollection folder you can find a json with a collection which was used to test the demos.The media folder can be ignored since that is just a file containing some media files I used to complement the guide files.In the references folder you can find a lot of interesting links to different sections of AWS documentation aswell as some personal notes/projects that are not very well structured but can definetly be helfull.

IMPORTANT CONCEPT:
================================
When working with Infrastructure as code is important to know about the DRIFT concept which is when changes are made over predefined infrastructure within the code, in those cases CFN wont be able to keep track of the changes and could cause frustraiting errors.

Maybe the following paragraphs generated by ChatGPT (reafirmed by me and deeper documentation reads about CFN) helps to clarify about drifting:

"If you create a new resource outside of CloudFormation, such as through a Lambda function, and that resource is not managed by CloudFormation, then it would not be considered drifting because CloudFormation is not aware of the resource's existence.

Drift in CloudFormation occurs when the actual state of the resources in the stack differs from the expected state defined in the CloudFormation template. This can happen when changes are made to the resources outside of CloudFormation, or when CloudFormation fails to create, update or delete resources as defined in the template.

If you create a new resource outside of CloudFormation, and that resource is not managed by CloudFormation, then CloudFormation will not track its state. In this case, it's important to ensure that the resource does not have any dependencies on other resources that are managed by CloudFormation, and that it does not interfere with the overall functionality of the CloudFormation stack"

Remember for example that ApiKeys or UsagePlans are available within all the APIs of a region so, deleting the Stack will then delete the API but not the Key/Usage plans (if they were created outside of the CFN/SAM logic code) however you could maybe expect to face some isuess while deleting a stack since the usage plans and Apikeys gets in fact vinculated to the API they want to be used in, and I do not know for the moment if AWS handles the desvinculation automatically or if it throws an error since those resources will depend on the existing status of the ones the stack could try to delete/remove/update.
