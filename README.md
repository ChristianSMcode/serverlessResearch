The purpose of this repo is just to document some of the features of different AWS services related to
serverless infrastructure.Also this will include some demos to illustrate real scenarios applying some of 
the features.

You should start with the guide folder and follow the order of the files which will the lead you to the demos
folder, in the postmanCollection folder you can find a json with a collection which was used to test the demos.The media folder can be ignored since that is just a file containing some media files I used to complement the guide files.In the references folder you can find a lot of interesting links to different sections of AWS documentation aswell as some personal notes/projects that are not very well structured but can definetly be helfull.
